  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>As a boy, I grew up Vietnam in a small fishing village off the coast near Saigon.  During the day, I spent my time outdoors picking fruits, swimming, playing marbles,and rolling around the green pastures. At night, I set my eyes on the starry lit sky. Currently, I live in Brooklyn, NY as a transplant from the Bay area.  I love watching and playing sports and I work at <a href="www.nyvisiongroup.com">NY Vision Group.</a> This is my first website!</p>
